Definition: A user story represents a piece of business value that can be delivered within a sprint. It answers who needs it, what they need, and why they need it.
Components of a Good User Story:
Description: Clearly outlines the business value and includes any assumptions or details.
Acceptance Criteria: Defines what "done" means for the story, often using the Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then).
INVEST Acronym: Good user stories should be:
Independent: Can be prioritized and moved around in the backlog.
Negotiable: Not overly detailed, allowing for adjustments.
Valuable: Provide clear business value.
Estimable: Can be estimated in terms of effort.
Small: Should be manageable within a sprint.
Testable: Can be verified against the acceptance criteria.
Epics: Larger user stories that cannot be completed in a single sprint, which can be broken down into smaller user stories.
This framework helps ensure clarity and alignment between stakeholders and developers, minimizing misunderstandings during the development process.
